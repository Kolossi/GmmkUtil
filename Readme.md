# GmmkUtil

## Summary

An executable that allows setting the profile of the Glorious PC Gaming Race
GMMK Keyboard to be set on the command line.

My use case for this is to set to a Red wave profile whilst autotype of my
password manager is in operation, then set back to usual profile when it
has completed.

I was disappointed that the manufacturer [GMMK Keyboard Editor](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/pages/gmmk-software-download) app
did not support command-line options to issue commands, and support
just bounced requests for support to develop an open-source app to enhance
their product.  Boo!

I proceeded to develop this by sniffing the USB packets sent by the 
GMMK Keyboard Editor app.

## Future 

To be developed over time.

Ultimately I'd like to enable a [DasKeyboard 5Q](https://www.daskeyboard.com/x/x50q-rgb-mechanical-keyboard/)-like experience on my GMMK
keyboard using the leds as a dashboard for stats, alerts etc.

## Supported models

Currently this app is only guaranteed to work on my UK ISO Full Keyboard
with S/N 2019xxxxxxxxxx! The profile-change will probably work on any keyboard
though.

## Contribute

It would be great to get reports of this working on other keyboards.

It would be even greater to receive Pull Requests for extra device support,
features etc.
